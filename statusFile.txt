Finished revision today . Left with prefix sum concept and equilibrium position question ( will solve it tomorrow and finish the remaining 18 problems by eod) fell short in confidence since I couldnt solve an easy question today.. wont repeat that in case I dont get anything I will look into the solution and learn and rewrite from today.. 31 days more ..

Finished 16 coding questions ( learned a lot of new concepts) quite a productive day... still lagging behind the schedule but I am okay with it since I am consistent..
